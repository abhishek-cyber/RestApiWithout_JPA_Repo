Ensure your database is up and running, and the books table is created with the appropriate schema before running the application.
The SQL statements in the BookService class are basic. You might need to adjust them based on your actual database schema.
This example uses an in-memory MySql database for simplicity, but you can switch to any database by changing the datasource configuration
in application.properties and adding the corresponding driver dependency to your pom.xml or build.gradle file.
